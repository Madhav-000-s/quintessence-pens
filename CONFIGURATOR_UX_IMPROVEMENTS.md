## üéØ Primary Improvements

### 1. **Non-Blocking Pricing Display**
**Problem:** Price summary was a fixed overlay blocking the 3D viewer

**Solution:**
- Created a **sticky price badge** that shows total price at all times
  - Desktop: Bottom-left corner
  - Mobile: Bottom-center for better accessibility
- Converted pricing summary into a **collapsible drawer** that slides up on demand
- Added backdrop blur and click-outside-to-close functionality
- Keyboard shortcut: `P` to toggle pricing drawer

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/configurator/PriceBadge.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/configurator/PricingSummary.tsx` (redesigned)
- `src/lib/store/configurator.ts` (added drawer state)
- `src/app/configurator/page.tsx` (integrated components)

---

### 2. **Progress Indicator**
**Enhancement:** Visual feedback showing customization completion status

**Features:**
- Progress bar with percentage completion
- Individual step indicators with checkmarks
- Steps marked complete based on user selections vs defaults
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Shows which configuration sections have been customized

**File Created:**
- `src/components/configurator/ProgressIndicator.tsx`

**Integration:**
- Added to ConfigPanel header in `src/components/configurator/ConfigPanel.tsx`

| `Ctrl/‚åò + D` | Download configuration |
| `Ctrl/‚åò + R` | Reset to defaults (with confirmation) |

| `Esc` | Close drawers/dialogs |

**Features:**
